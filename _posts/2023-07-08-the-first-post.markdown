The purpose of this blog is to act as a journal on my engineering and trading exploits. In the past, keeping it private hasn't worked out too well for me as I kept repeating the same mistakes, or revisiting bad ideas over and over again. I hope by sharing it in the open keeps me in check and responsible of the things I do in private. 

I am always fascinated by the financial markets. I think it is the ideal representation of democracy and equality as people vote with their money, and their decision have a ripple effect across the financial landscape. Over the long run, I think the market represents the state of the economy at large. But in the short term, we see all kinds of kinks and inefficiency caused by all sorts of unpredicatable, or often illogical factors. And so my main goal is to try to learn and identify as much ineficiencies as possible, and capture it quickly using the other part of my passion: computers.

There are lots of things to discover, and at the time of this writing, I believe there are things I have yet to learn that are essential to stay in this business. But I'm quite sure I have found my calling, and look forward for a grand adventure ahead.

Let this first post mark the start of a long journey aheadðŸš€
